Hello, I'm Andreea Bărbuceanu, a dedicated and detail-oriented data analyst with a rich and diverse background in various industries. With a strong educational foundation and a passion for uncovering insights within data, I have cultivated a career that combines analytical precision with strategic foresight.
I hold degrees in both Finance and Tourism and Marketing, which have equipped me with a broad understanding of business dynamics and the critical role that data plays in driving success. My formal education has been further complemented by advanced certifications from IBM and Google, focusing on data analytics, data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI, and programming languages like Python and SQL.

Over the course of my professional journey, I have had the privilege of working across several key industries, including retail, finance, logistics, and quality assurance. I began my career at Domo Retail SA, the largest home appliances company in Romania, where I served as an Assistant Manager in Sales & Marketing for over six years. This role provided me with invaluable experience in market analysis and customer insights.

Driven by a desire to explore the financial sector, I transitioned to the role of Chief Financial Officer Assistant at Gorenje Group Romania. My time there was instrumental in honing my analytical skills, particularly in financial modelling and forecasting. However, my passion for exploration and curiosity about new cultures led me to Dubai, where I joined Global Logistics as a Marketing & Sales Specialist. My dedication and strategic thinking earned me a promotion to Business Development Manager, where I spent four years.

After Dubai, my journey took me to Edinburgh, Scotland, where I joined Burton’s Biscuits, a company owned by Ferrero, as a QA Specialist. Here, I managed raw materials for a large-scale operation, further deepening my expertise in quality assurance and supply chain analytics.

For the past three years, I have embraced the digital nomad lifestyle, travelling the world while continuing to develop my skills as a data analyst. During this time, I have worked on various projects, applying my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to help businesses make informed decisions. My work is driven by a deep-seated belief that data is more than just numbers—it’s a powerful tool that when analyzed and interpreted correctly, can unlock new opportunities and drive strategic growth.

What motivates me most as a data analyst is the opportunity to explore data from different perspectives, ask the right questions, and provide clarity in situations where the path forward may not be immediately clear. I find great satisfaction in knowing that my work helps businesses make informed decisions, reduce uncertainties, and capitalize on opportunities. Every dataset tells a story, and I am passionate about uncovering and interpreting these narratives to support strategic decision-making.

At the core of my approach is a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation. In a field that evolves as rapidly as data analytics, I stay engaged with the latest tools, methodologies, and industry trends, ensuring that my skills remain sharp and relevant. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data analytics and artificial intelligence, where I believe there is immense potential to create innovative solutions that can transform how businesses operate and compete.

I look forward to continuing my journey in data analytics, collaborating with forward-thinking organizations, and contributing to projects that make a real impact.
